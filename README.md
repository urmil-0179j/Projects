# Projects
Game:

This is the Project made in my Collge First Year during the course CSE100 (Fundamentals of Computer Programming). This project is made in group of three members. Project consist of two games that is Snake and Tic-Tac-Toe. Snake game is made in python using pygame, random, and OS modules. It is an user interactive game where the user can expirence the different window for the game and can see his/her score as well as their previous high score. Whereas the Tic-Tac-Toe is multi-player game and is made using python only. It is command-line interface game where both user need to put their entries or location where they need to place their Os and Xs.

Image Manupulation:

This is the Project made in 3rd semester of my Collge for the course MAT248 (Applied Linear Algebra). This project is made in the group of five members. As the name suggest it is mainly about image manupulation. Project consists a python file and two images. Python file reads two images do several manupulations such as Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication. And reades one image and do manupulations such as Negative, Mirroring, Channel Splitting, Transpose, Gray-Scale, Convolution (in 3*3 and 5*5 kernel) for that image. For doing so we are using different python libraries such as numpy, cv2, PIL, matplotlib.image.
